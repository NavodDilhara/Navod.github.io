    <h1 class="paragraphblog"> My Thoughts on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</h1>
    <p class="blog2">So, let’s talk about "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League." This game was made by Rocksteady Studios, the same folks who brought us the awesome Batman: Arkham series. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment published it. You’d think with that kind of pedigree, this game would be amazing, right? Well, not so much. </p>
    <p class="blog2">First off, they did the unthinkable: they killed Batman. But not just any Batman, the Arkham Knight Batman we’ve all grown to love. And they did it in the most pathetic way possible. Seriously, it feels like a huge slap in the face to everyone who followed his journey. Instead of giving him a meaningful or heroic end, they just tossed him aside like he was nothing. That alone is enough to make a lot of people hate this game. </p>
    <p class="blog2">Now, let's talk about the gameplay. You’d expect top-notch combat from Rocksteady, but nope, it’s pretty bland. They tried to mix the abilities of the Suicide Squad members, like Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, but it just doesn’t come together well. It’s clunky and gets old really fast. The story? Don’t even get me started. It’s like they didn’t even try. The plot is all over the place, and the characters make some really dumb decisions. It’s like they forgot how to tell a good story. Remember how emotionally invested we were in the Arkham series? Yeah, none of that here. And then there are the graphics and performance issues.</p>
    <p class="blog2"> For a game in this day and age, you’d expect it to look great and run smoothly. But no, it’s glitchy and just feels unfinished. It really takes you out of the experience when you’re constantly dealing with visual bugs and performance problems. All in all, "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League" is a big letdown. From killing Batman in the worst way possible to the boring gameplay, bad story, and technical issues, it’s no wonder this game is getting so much hate. It’s a real shame, especially coming from the studio that gave us such great Batman games before.</p>
